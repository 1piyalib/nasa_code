0. Stated learning Unity engine
 Not our expertise - switched to Python after couple of weeks
1.  How to visualize the data quickly? The landing and destination array number was wrong in guide (Data File Row Number 5161666)
solution - create a scatter plot with color slope, superimpose landing and destination site
2. Too much time time to process
use numpi - still slow
3. Plotly z axis takes a list of lists - try to understand
4. csv file is too big to debug and too slow.
   create a small csv file to debug
5. Rabit hole chase to use matplotlib surface plot it needs z = f(x,y)
    Use  plotly mesh plot
6. Plotly can not plot all data
    Find region of data with most coverage
7. How to undersytand the x y scanning

8. Get data into a nxn matrix

9. Debugging data
  create small subset of data
10. How do we verify azimuth and elevation calculations?

11. azimuth and elevation calculations - cartesian vs spherica

12. Point to presentation of calculations
